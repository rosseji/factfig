So we are getting to work on a virtual machine just to use some fast specs, 32 core CPU and 52Gb RAM... Should be fun...

a machine learning model (trying to predict whether it will rain based on historic data...) in four clicks

... a decision tree model:

Tips: 
Max depth is the amount of binary splits.
Min bucket is the amount of data required for the model to include the category (ie exclude)
rattle logs the R code which you can just run in Rstudio (Export)

Partitioning data to have data to train the model, and then other data to test the data on.
