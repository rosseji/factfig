  Measuring the likeihood that two or more factor levels (categories) appear together in observation (row).
You could imagine that Aidan would want to know how likely is it that a particular beers are purchased on the same bill...

``` {r}
library(datasets)
titanic.raw <- as.data.frame(Titanic)
titanic.raw <- titanic.raw[1:4]

library(arules)
library(magrittr)## load required library
rules.all <- titanic.raw %>% apriori() ## run the APRIORI algorithm

## ----have a look at rules------------------------------------------------
rules.all %>% length() ## number of rules discovered
rules.all %>% inspect() ## print all rules

## ----mine rules with constraints, tidy=F---------------------------------
## run APRIORI again to find rules with rhs containing "Survived" only
rules.surv <- titanic.raw %>% apriori(
             control = list(verbose=F),
             parameter = list(minlen=2, supp=0.005, conf=0.8),
             appearance = list(rhs=c("Survived=No",
                                     "Survived=Yes"),
                               default="lhs"))
## keep three decimal places
quality(rules.surv) <- rules.surv %>% quality() %>% round(digits=3)
## sort rules by lift
rules.surv.sorted <- rules.surv %>% sort(by="lift")
## ----inspect rules-------------------------------------------------------
rules.surv.sorted %>% inspect() ## print rules

```

Fraction of transactions that contain both X and Y
support -> Fraction of transactions/obs that contain both LHS and RHS
confidence -> Measures how often each item in RHS appears in transactions/obs that contain LHS

lift -> 
A lift value greater than 1  could indicate that LHS and RHS appear more often together than expected. 
A lift smaller than 1 could indicate that LHS and RHS appear less often together than expected

Can use association rules to predict/model future combinations...
