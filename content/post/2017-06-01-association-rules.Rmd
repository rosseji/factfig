  Measuring the likeihood that two or more factor levels (categories) appear together in observation (row).
You could imagine that Aidan would want to know how likely is it that a particular beers are purchased on the same bill...

``` {r, eval = F, echo = T}
library(arules)

rules.surv <- titanic.raw %>% apriori(
             control = list(verbose=F),
             parameter = list(minlen=2, supp=0.005, conf=0.8),
             appearance = list(rhs=c("Survived=No",
                                     "Survived=Yes"),
                               default="lhs"))
## keep three decimal places
quality(rules.surv) <- rules.surv %>% quality() %>% round(digits=3)
## sort rules by lift
rules.surv.sorted <- rules.surv %>% sort(by="lift")

## ----inspect rules-------------------------------------------------------
rules.surv.sorted %>% inspect() ## print rules
```

Which got you a nice output:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
df <- dplyr::tibble(lhs = list(c("Class=2nd","Age=Child"),
                          c("Class=2nd","Sex=Female","Age=Child"),
                          c("Class=1st","Sex=Female")),
                    div = c("=>","=>","=>"),
                    rhs = c("Survived=Yes","Survived=Yes","Survived=Yes"),
                    support = c(0.011,0.006,0.064),
                    confidence = c(1.000,1.000,0.972),
                    lift = c(3.096,3.096,3.010))

knitr::kable(df)
```

### Definitions:
support -> Fraction of transactions/obs that contain both LHS and RHS
confidence -> Measures how often each item in RHS appears in transactions/obs that contain LHS

lift -> 
A lift value greater than 1  could indicate that LHS and RHS appear more often together than expected. 
A lift smaller than 1 could indicate that LHS and RHS appear less often together than expected

One can use association rules to predict/model future combinations...
