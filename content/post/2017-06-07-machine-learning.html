<p>The three methods of machine learning are: classification, clustering, and regression.</p>
<p>Classification is the easiest one to visualise, so we spent most of our time on that.</p>
<p>First tip was straight out of the school of Aidan: visualise your model in the data space, rather than just visualising your data in the model space:</p>

<p>I understood part of the method of classification as learning that defining characteristics from a history (a sample data set with known categories) and create a map in the data space to differentiate between the categories.</p>
