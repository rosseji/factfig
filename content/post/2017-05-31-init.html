<p>Nathan, Aidan and I can now blog from R so we will put up some of the other content we went through here just for fun. Then afterwards we can use it for Factions and Figures…</p>
<p>For example, some cool packages:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(plotly)
library(sf)</code></pre>
<p>And there were stickers…</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="http://dplyr.tidyverse.org/logo.png" />

</div>
