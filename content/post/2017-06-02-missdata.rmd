We met a great guy, [Nick](https://github.com/njtierney), who is based out of Monash Uni. He's made two cool packages that deal with missing data!

[narnia](https://github.com/njtierney/narnia)
```{r, eval = F}
devtools::install_github("njtierney/narnia")
library(narnia)
```

and

[visdat](https://github.com/njtierney/visdat)
```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("njtierney/visdat")
library(visdat)
```


Might be useful for things like "HoursWorked" in H.
