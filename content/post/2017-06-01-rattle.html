<p>So we are getting to work on a virtual machine just to use some fast specs, 32 core CPU and 52Gb RAM… Should be fun…</p>

<p>a machine learning model (trying to predict whether it will rain based on historic data…) in four clicks</p>

<p>… a decision tree model:</p>

<p>Tips: Max depth is the amount of binary splits. Min bucket is the amount of data required for the model to include the category (ie exclude) rattle logs the R code which you can just run in Rstudio (Export)</p>
