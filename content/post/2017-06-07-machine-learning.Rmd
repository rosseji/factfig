The three methods of machine learning are: classification, clustering, and regression.

Classification is the easiest one to visualise, so we spent most of our time on that.

First tip was straight out of the school of Aidan: visualise your model in the data space, rather than just visualising your data in the model space:

I understood part of the method of classification as learning that defining characteristics from a history (a sample data set with known categories) and create a map in the data space to differentiate between the categories.
